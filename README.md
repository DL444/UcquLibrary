# UcquLibrary
### Library for UCQU ### 

This repository is an ongoing effort to refactor and renovate the codebase of previous UCQU library, to facilitate contribution, and to move existing local logic to Microsoft Azure. 

This library is not compatible with the current version of UCQU.

After building the project, a NuGet package would be available in the output folder. You can set that directory up as the NuGet source.
